In addition to TubeKit, which incorporates a suit of tools to perform query-based YouTube crawling, we have developed a few small tools that lets one grab various forms of information off YouTube without running queries.
These tools are included in this folder as PHP scripts. Each script can be run as "php <script name>" on command line. With such a run, the script will show appropriate options to pass with it. You can also open a PHP file in any text editor and read the instructions and the code. Some of the tools require database support and/or additional tools. Database creation and configuration scripts are provided in database.txt file.
