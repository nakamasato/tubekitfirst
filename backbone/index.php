Before it is totally functional, there are a couple of things you need to do:			<ul>				<li>Click on 'Queries' link on this page and enter your queries there. Your crawler will keep running these queries based on the preferences you gave.</li>				<li>There has to be a file 'cron' in your project directory. Open a terminal, go to your project directory, and run 'crontab cron' to set the schedule of various tasks for the crawler.</li>			</ul>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td>Once your crawler is up and running, you can monitor the results by clicking on 'Monitor' link above. From the monitor page, you can browse your collection by queries or videos. You can also search for a video in your collection from there.			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td>If at some point you want to edit your queries, you should directly access your MySQL database and do so.</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td>Have questions? <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#99;&#104;&#105;&#114;&#97;&#103;&#115;&#64;&#114;&#117;&#116;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;">E-mail</a> us.
