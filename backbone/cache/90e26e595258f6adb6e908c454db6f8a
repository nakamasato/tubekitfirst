I never learned to count my blessings, I choose instead to dwell in my disasters. I walk on down the hill, through grass, grown tall and brown and still its hard somehow to let go of my pain. On past the busted back of that old and rusted Cadillac that sinks into this field, collecting rain. Will I always feel this way? So empty, so estranged. And of these cut-throat busted sunsets, these cold and damp white mornings I have grown weary. If through my cracked and dusted dime-store lips I spoke these words out loud would no one hear me? Lay your blouse across the chair, let fall the flowers from from your hair and kiss me with that country mouth, so plain. Outside, the rain is tapping on the leaves, to me it sounds like they're applauding us the the quiet love we made. Will I always feel this way? So empty, so estranged. Well I looked my demons in the eyes, laid bare my chest, said "Do your best, destroy me. You see, I've been to hell and back so many times, I must admit you kind of bore me." There's a lot of things that can kill a man, there's a lot of ways to die, listen, some already did that walked beside me. There's a lot of things I don't understand, why so many people lie. Its the hurt I hide that fuels the fire inside me. Will I always feel this way?

I never learned to count my blessings, I choose instead to dwell in my disasters. I walk on down the hill, through grass, grown tall and brown and still its hard somehow to let go of my pain. On past the busted back of that old and rusted Cadillac that sinks into this field, collecting rain. Will I always feel this way? So empty, so estranged. And of these cut-throat busted sunsets, these cold and damp white mornings I have grown weary. If through my cracked and dusted dime-store lips I spoke these words out loud would no one hear me? Lay your blouse across the chair, let fall the flowers from from your hair and kiss me with that country mouth, so plain.

The face of everyday that haunts me. I can't pull away my blank stare. A thousand times should prove I don't care. But hands can't steal the light that makes me.
