"Fernando" also features on the multi-million selling ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits compilation. This song was to become ABBA's biggest selling single of all time, selling 6000000 copies in 1976 alone. All in all, Fernando sold over 10 million copies worldwide. "Fernando" was not originally an ABBA song but was written for ABBA member Anni-Frid Lyngstad. It appeared on her 1975 #1 Swedish solo album, Frida ensam. The song was written by Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Stig Anderson and carried the working title of "Tango". Preparations for recording began in August 1975. The original Swedish language version's lyrics were written by ABBA's manager Stig Anderson and differ substantially from the English language version. In the original, the narrator tries to console the heartbroken Fernando, who has lost his great love. "The sorrow can be hard to bear, but the fact that friends let us down is something we all have to cope with". The bittersweet chorus goes: "Long live love, our best friend, Fernando.
